            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p class="fragment">Our goal was to create a hardware based project that utilized analog display and user input.</p>
            <p class="fragment">An analog plane simulator that uses Arduino microcontrollers to read outside temperature, user input via a joystick, and motion through an ultrasonic sensor.</p>

        <section id="fragments">
            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p class="fragment">The project's purpose was to provide a safety simulation which factored in environmental variables that were crucial to flight and to train individuals in maneuvering during dire situations</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p class="fragment">The project is divided into two modules, the temperature sensing module and the motion/user input module.</p>
            <p class="fragment">The temperature module is composed of an Arduino Yún connected to a temperature sensor and an LCD screen. The module reads the outside temperature and formats it onto the LCD display, which can be adjust for brightness using a potentiometer</p>

        <section id="fragments">
            <h2>Description Continued </h2>
            <p class="fragment">The motion/user input module is composed of a standard Arduino microcontroller connected to an ultrasonic sensor that reads the proximity of objects. A red LED is lit up when the proximity is too close, providing a warning for the user. Additionally, this module incorporates the joystick control of the aircraft. This joystick piece adjusts the position of the aircraft.</p>

            <h2>Our Goal </h2>
            <p class="fragment"> We designed a list of safety precautions aircrafts should follow during flight, include ideal temperatures, proper pitch and yaw, and maneuverability. </p>

        <section id="fragments">
            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            <p class="fragment"> Our initial scope consisted of actual movement via connecting the Arduino Yún, temperature sensors, and ultrasonic sensors to a mini drone which would provide real time data to control modules. Another portion of the project was a aircraft simulation in Unity that used the user input for the animations. These aspects were not implemented in the final simulation due to time constraint, however they could be later implemented along with a more robust design. </p>

                The environmental variables measured by the temperature sensor and ultrasonic sensor will be read and displayed on the LED screens.            </p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <p class="fragment">
                Project members were exposed to Arduino hardware and software making use of the many hardware pieces that come in a SparkFun Inventors Kit.            </p>

            <h2>Our Goal </h2>
            <p class="fragment">
                Our idea can be improved by using block chain technology in order to communicate with nearby aircrafts.
                This will see if a adjacent aircrafts has problems and other aircraft could take action.
                This can create a decentrailized network for aircrafts instead of depending solely on ground stations.
